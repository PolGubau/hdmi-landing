        This website, operated by <strong>{name}</strong>, uses cookies and similar
        technologies to improve the browsing experience, analyse traffic and provide basic
        functionality. Below we explain what cookies are, which types we use and how you
        can manage them.
      </p>

      <h2>1. What are cookies?</h2>
      <p>
        Cookies are small text files that websites store on your device when you visit
        them. They allow information about your visit to be remembered — such as your
        language or theme (light/dark) preferences — making navigation easier and the
        site more useful on future visits.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Types of cookies we use</h2>

      <h3>2.1 Technical cookies (strictly necessary)</h3>
      <p>
        These are essential for the correct functioning of the website. Without them,
        certain services or features would not be available.
      </p>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Purpose</th>
            <th>Duration</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td><code>theme</code></td>
            <td>Stores the user's theme preference (light/dark).</td>
            <td>Persistent (localStorage)</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <h3>2.2 Analytical cookies</h3>
      <p>
        These allow us to count visits and analyse traffic to improve the performance and
        content of the site. All information collected is anonymous.
      </p>
